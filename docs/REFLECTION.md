# Reflection Log

This document captures reflections on the development of 3D geometric classes in Java, focusing on design patterns, principles, and lessons learned.


/*In one of the codes from Cube3D, the comments fromCenterAndDimensions method tells me that it is a static factory method that creates a Cube3D object based on a center point and dimensions. It performs input validation to ensure that the center point is not null and that the dimensions are positive. It then calculates the vertices of the cube based on the center and dimensions, and logs the creation of the cube. Finally, it returns a new Cube3D object initialized with the calculated vertices.
